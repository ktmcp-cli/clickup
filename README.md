# ClickUp CLI

A command-line interface for the ClickUp API. Manage tasks, projects, and workflows from your terminal.

> **Disclaimer**: This is an unofficial CLI tool and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by ClickUp.

## Features

- **Resource Management** — List, get, create, update, and delete resources
- **JSON output** — All commands support `--json` for scripting and piping
- **Colorized output** — Clean, readable terminal output

## Why CLI > MCP

MCP servers are complex, stateful, and require a running server process. A CLI is:

- **Simpler** — Just a binary you call directly
- **Composable** — Pipe output to `jq`, `grep`, `awk`, and other tools
- **Scriptable** — Use in shell scripts, CI/CD pipelines, cron jobs
- **Debuggable** — See exactly what's happening with `--json` flag
- **AI-friendly** — AI agents can call CLIs just as easily as MCPs, with less overhead

npm install -g @ktmcp-cli/clickup
